# CS-320

Using the test classes I make sure that each functional requirement is met. For security, I only create mutators for attributes that should be updated, things like ID are left un-mutable. After reading through the user requirements I create todo comments for each function that I neeed to make to meet those requirements before I being programming to ensure I handle all of them. I try to be methodical and thorough so that my programs meet all of the needs of the user.
